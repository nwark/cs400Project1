There once was a man named Steve.  He was never the type of person who would be considered a protagonist because he was always in the backgroud of the action.  The world Steve lived on, Pandora, was always filled with action. Steve would greet everyone he meet with a "Heyoooooooo" no matter who they were or what they were doing.  But then one day, Steven came arross an annoying little robot and it was the first time Steve didn't say "Heyoooooooo" as a greeting.
